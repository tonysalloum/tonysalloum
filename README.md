Hi! Iâ€™m Tony, a front end developer in Toronto. 

A recent grad of Juno Collegeâ€™s Immersive Web Development Bootcamp. I come armed with ample experience in using JavaScript, React, Redux, jQuery, HTML, CSS and Sass, to build clean, organized, and accessible web applications. With a background in marketing, I love design and the role it plays in making a userâ€™s experience great. 

Before entering Juno Collegeâ€™s Immersive Web Development Bootcamp in February 2020, I worked as a head pizza chef, and prior to that, an account manager at a marketing agency. 

I am an avid soccer player, biker, cook, and proud cat dad.
